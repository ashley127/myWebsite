				<h2><i>holding on, letting go</i></h2>
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
				The moonlight trickled through the window, illuminating the room with a gentle, ethereal radiance, highlighting the delicate features of my 
				daughter’s face. Her round cheeks were drained of their usual rosy hue and her eyes were closed as she slept soundly. 
				I sat beside her bed, clutching her little hand, which was adorned with colorful bracelets and stickers, listening to the steady beeping of the 
				heart monitor. 
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
				Mila’s small body was hidden beneath a tangle of wires and tubes, as if consuming her like vines wrapping around a tree. 
				Her chest rose and fell in shallow, labored breaths and my heart ached deeply as I watched her struggle. 
				It has been two weeks since the accident. I closed my eyes, the memories flooding back to me as I sat in silence.  
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					The sun had just begun to peak over the horizon as we walked hand in hand. My wife was carrying a small cooler with water and snacks 
					while I held a few folding chairs and Mila bounced with excitement. As we reached the field, we could see the team already warming up 
					and Mila quickly joined them. I watched Mila sprint down the field, my heart swelling with pride, but then suddenly she collapsed. 
					I could hear the panic of other parents and players, the sound of the ambulance sirens growing louder. After numerous hours of waiting 
					at the hospital and endless tests, we finally received our daughter’s diagnosis. 
					A rare heart disease that would cause her heart to slowly weaken over time.  
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					I slowly opened my eyes to the sound of machines beeping, and walked over to the corner of the room where my wife slept on the couch. 
					Her face was etched with worry and exhaustion, dark circles underlining her tired eyes. The couch she was sleeping on was worn, 
					its cushions flattened from the countless nights she had spent there. I knelt beside her and gently brushed a piece of hair away 
					from her face, kissing her forehead. She opened her eyes, and I could see a slight smile forming on her lips as our eyes met. 
					We sat there, hand in hand, watching our daughter sleep.  We didn’t have to say a word, the unspoken understanding between us was 
					enough. At that moment, the weight of our worries and fears melted away, and it felt like ten years ago when I had first met the 
					love of my life.  
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					“Why don’t you head home, take a hot shower, and get a new set of freshly washed clothes? You don’t have to worry about Mila, 
					I’ll watch over her,” I suggested, breaking the silence.  She hesitated for a moment, her eyes flicking back and forth between 
					our daughter and me. “Are you sure?” she finally asked, her voice barely above a whisper. “I don’t want to leave her.” 
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					I nodded and pulled her in for a hug, understanding her fear and reluctance. “Just go Ellie, I promise to call you if anything happens. 
					I know you’re tired, you deserve a rest.” She sighed, her body relaxing slightly as she leaned into me. “Okay,” she said, her voice laced 
					with exhaustion. “I’ll be back in the morning.” 
				</p>
				
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					I watched Ellie gather her things, her movements slow and sluggish. As she reached the door, she turned to me and gave me a small smile. 
					“I love you,” she mouthed, before disappearing into the hallway. 
				</p>
				
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					The room fell silent again, the only sound coming from the equipment monitoring Mila’s vital signs and the soft buzzing of the 
					fluorescent lights. I sat back down next to her bed and held her hand in mine. The gentle sound of her breathing and the warmth 
					of her hand lulled me into a sense of calm, and my eyelids began to grow heavy. 
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>
					BEEP .. BEEP … BEEP  
				</i></p>
				
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					My eyes shot open and I jumped up, my heart racing. Mila’s body shook violently, her small chest heaving as she struggled to breathe. 
				The heart monitor was out of control trying to keep up with Mila, its beeps growing faster and more frantic. 
				I quickly pressed the emergency button, calling for the nurses and doctors to come. They rushed into the room, 
				pushing me out of the way as they began to work on her. I stood frozen with horror as I watched them trying to revive her, 
				but Mila’s skin remained a pale, ghostly white. My heart felt like it would explode, and I couldn’t hold back the tears that flowed down my face. 
				I wanted to do something, anything, to help my daughter but I couldn’t.  
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					I could only watch. 
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					Finally, the beeping of the heart monitor resumed and made a steady beat. I collapsed onto the floor, 
					tears streaming down my face from relief. The medical team continued to work on Mila, preparing to transfer her to the PICU.  
				</p>
				
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					My hands shaking, I reached for the phone to call Ellie. She rushed back to the hospital with tears swelling in her eye and ran towards me for an embrace. 
					Her breathing was heavy and I could feel her heart pounding against mine. “How is she?” she whispered, wiping away her tears. I couldn’t bring myself to 
					tell her the truth, that Mila’s condition was still critical and uncertain. Instead, I simply hugged her tighter and whispered, 
					“We’ll have to see it through.”
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					Ellie’s tears soaked into my shirt as we stood in the hallway, holding each other. We were both too scared to let go, too scared to face the reality 
					of the situation. Eventually, we pulled apart, and Ellie made her way over to Mila’s bedside. She took her hand and sat down beside her, tears 
					streaming down her face.  
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					As the sun rose, the PICU was bathed in a soft pink light. The first rays of sunlight began to peek through the window, and I took in a deep breath. 
					“Today will be better,” I whispered to my wife, trying to re-adjust our mood knowing that Mila will be awake soon. We needed to be strong for her.  
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					We sat next to her bed waiting patiently for her to wake up.  “Good morning”, Mila said softly with a faint smile. Ellie let out a slight gasp and 
planted a kiss on her forehead. “Good morning, my love. How are you feeling today?”  I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. 
I held Mila and Ellie’s hands tightly, one in each palm.  “I’m okay, my tummy feels funny though,” Mila giggled with a brighter smile, 
trying to reassure us that she was fine. A sense of relief washed over me, and I finally felt like I could breathe. 
“That’s good to hear. The doctors will be here soon to check on you, and we’ll see if we can get you out of here soon.” Mila nodded and slowly 
dozed off back to sleep. I stayed by her side, holding her hand, as the morning sun filled the room and Ellie rested her head on my shoulder. 
For the first time in weeks, we felt a glimmer of hope that maybe everything would be okay.
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					The door to the room slowly opened, and a doctor walked in with a grave expression on his face. “Excuse me, parents of Mila, may I speak to you in the 
hallway?” I felt a knot form in my stomach and Ellie squeezed my hand tightly, digging her ring into my finger as we followed the doctor out of the room. 
My heart was pounding in my chest as I tried to anticipate what would happen next. The doctor cleared his throat and began to speak, his voice low and 
serious. “I’m sorry to inform you, but Mila’s heart is too weak to continue supporting her body. The only option for Mila now is to receive a 
transplant for one of her heart valves. Unfortunately, there are currently no suitable donors for Mila, and her condition is critical. 
If she does not receive a transplant within the next 48 hours, her life may be in danger again.” Ellie let out a sob and buried her face in my chest, 
while my mind raced trying to comprehend what was happening. “Is there anything we can do? Any experimental treatments, anything? 
There must be another option . . . This can’t be the end. ” I asked pleadingly as my eyes welled up with tears and my voice began to crack. 
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					The doctor hesitated, looking down at his hands before meeting my gaze. “There is one last resort option. It’s not a common practice and it’s not 
without risks, but it’s something to consider.” He paused, gathering his thoughts before continuing. “A living donor transplant is an option, 
but in this case, where you are donating a heart valve, it is an extremely complex and delicate procedure, but it could save Mila’s life.” 
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					“Are you saying that I could donate one of my heart valves to Mila?” I asked with tears streaming down my cheeks.  The doctor nodded. 
“Yes, as her father, you are a suitable match, and your heart valve could save her life. But . . .” The doctor paused, as if not wanting to finish his 
sentence. “But what? Tell me! I would do anything to save my baby!” I practically shouted. “But the procedure carries significant risk complications. 
It would shorten your lifespan significantly. You can expect to live for the next 5 years at most after the transplant.” 
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					I fell silent, not knowing what to think. “This is a difficult decision, please think it over and tell me what you decide. It is important that you make 
an informed decision. We’ll be here to support you and any questions you may have,” the doctor said, his voice gentle and understanding.
				</p>


				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					We went back to the room and I sat down next to Mila, who was still peacefully napping. I held her small hand in mine and everything fell quiet. My heart weighed heavily with emotions I couldn’t describe. The fear of losing her, the guilt of leaving my wife behind, and the overwhelming love I had for her, all swirled together in my mind. I held her hand tighter and closed my eyes, trying to control my crying. 
“Please, please. Heal my child.” I quietly sobbed, “She’s only six, she’s too young. You can’t take her away from me yet,” I bargained with God, 
“Please . . .  Please . . . Just give me a little more time with my baby.” I felt my wife’s arms wrap around me and we sat in silence for a few minutes. 
I could see the fear and uncertainty in my wife’s eyes. We were both holding our breath, waiting for something to happen, hoping for a miracle. 
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					“What are you thinking?” she finally asked, her voice soft. I took a deep breath, my eyes filled with tears. “I want to save Mila. 
God is giving me a chance to take all the pain from Mila, He’s giving me a chance to trade positions with her. I would have given anything for this. 
I can’t let my girl down when she needs me most,” I looked my wife in the eyes and held her hands, “I’m going to do it. 
I’m going to donate my heart valve to Mila. I can’t lose her and I know this is the best thing I can do for her. I’ll do it, no matter the cost.” 
My wife nodded, tears streaming down her face. “I’ll be right here with you,” she said, her voice filled with love and determination. 
				</p>

 
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					The days that followed were a blur of tests and consultations. But through it all, I knew that I had made the right decision. 
The morning before the operation, I set up my camera and recorded myself.  
				</p>
 
				<p style="text-indent: 40px"> <i>
					Click.
				</i>  
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					“Mila, my sweet girl,” I began, my voice cracking with emotion. “ In a few hours, I’m going to be giving you one of my heart valves. 
But don’t ever think for a moment that it was a sacrifice, because giving you a part of my heart is the greatest thing that could have happened to me. 
I want you to know that I will always be with you, in every beat of your heart. You are the reason I lived, and you will be the reason I will live on. 
I hope you grow up to be strong and brave, just like your mother. And always remember, you are loved and cherished, more than words can say. 
I love you, my dear Mila.”  
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px"> <i>
					Click.
				</i>  
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					I wiped away my tears and turned to Ellie, who was watching me with tears streaming down her face. I wiped them away 
					gently and took her in my arms, holding her tightly. “ I want you to know that you are the most amazing woman I have ever met. 
					I am so grateful to have you as my partner, my best friend, and the mother of my child. I know this is not the end, and 
					I will never be far. I will be there when you laugh, when you cry, and when you need a shoulder to lean on. 
					I will always be your rock. Ellie, I will always love you and I will always be proud of you. I’m sorry for having to leave you 
					so soon, but I know that you will be strong. I trust you, and I believe in you. I know you will raise our Mila to be a 
					strong and wonderful woman, just like you. I will always be with you both, watching over you, and looking out for you. 
					I love you, Ellie.” 
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					With those words, I kissed Ellie gently goodbye. And, as I lay in the operating room, ready to give my daughter the gift of life, 
 I knew that I would do it all over again in a heartbeat.
