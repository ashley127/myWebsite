				<p>
					blah blah blah.

                <p> List of takeaways:
                    <li>“There are times in life when we become so disconnected from ourselves that we must drill down and rewire those cut 
                        connections in our hearts, minds, and souls.”
                    </li>
                    <div class="ind">Being connected, in touch, and real with yourself is so important. If you're not, it's going to show up 
                        in every aspect of your life   
                    </div>
                    <li>“<mark>There's no substance behind hope.</mark> It's not a muscle you can develop, and it's not rooted down deep. It's an emotion that 
                        comes and goes.” 
                    </li>
                    <div class="ind"> Hope is an emotion. Emotions are not constant nor consistent. Discipline > motivation. 
                    </div>
                    <li>“With each passing minute, they became more and more resilient until they started to <i>believe</i> that 
                        they would survive. Their confidence didn't fade as the hours piled up; it actually grew!”
                    </li>
                    <div class="ind"> They began to believe because they were proving to themselves what they were capable of. 
                        All of the hurdles they have jumped fuel their belief in their abilities, the faith they had in themselves refused 
                        to let them quit as it got increasingly harder.  
                    </div>
					<li>
						<mark>“Belief is born in resilience”</mark>
					</li>
					<li>
						“Many people get it twisted and think my accomplishments directly correlate to my potential. My accomplishments do not equate to my potential. 
						The little I had was buried so deep most people would never have found it. Not only did I find it, I learned to maximize it.”
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Maximizing minimal potential. Hard work beats talent. Every. Fucking. Time.
					</div>
					<li>
						"A lot of folks feel like they are missing something in their lives - something money can't buy - and that makes them miserable. 
						The familiar gnawing in their gut returns, reminding them that the life they are living is not the fullest expression of who they 
						are or might become. Unfortunately, most people are not desperate enough to do anything about it. 
						<mark>You could be itchy as fuck to experience something different, to be somewhere different, or to become someone different, 
						but when the <u>slightest resistance</u> arises to challenge your resolve, you moonwalk right back </mark>into the unsatisfied person 
						you were before. Still itchy, still jonesing to be someone new, yet still trapped in your unfulfilling status quo."
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Toughen up and see it through. Become that bitch. Live life for yourself.
                    </div>
					<li>
						"I'm still haunted, but I've traded in my demons for evil-ass angels, and now, it's a good haunting. 
						I'm haunted by my future goals. Not my past failures. I'm haunted by what I may still become. 
						<mark>I'm haunted by my own thirst for evolution."</mark>
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Stay hungry. Stay real. Don't let your vision get blurred.
                    </div>
					<li>
						"All of our dreams and visions come with <u>expiration dates</u> etched in invisible ink. 
						Windows of opportunity can and do close, so it's imperative that we <mark>do not waste time on bullshit.</mark>
						None of us have any clue what's coming for us or when our time might run out, which is why I do my best to ignore anything that is 
						counterproductive. <u>I'm not suggesting that we act like robots, but we need to understand that 
						<i>forward motion gives our lives momentum.</i></u>"
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Get it done, breathe life to your goals. Don't let it stay in the drafts until it's too late. 
						And don't get caught up in the past, my dear, it's already over.  
                    </div>
					<li>
						"I just knew that I could not throw in the towel, and neither can you. Because there is no towel in our corner. 
						There is only water and a cut man. And if those are your only options, you have no choice but to keep fighting until you overcome 
						every last thing that once held you the fuck back."
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> There is no plan B. It's all or nothing, baby, so fucking full send it.  
                    </div>
					<li>
						You have been preoccupied by bullshit for way too long. It's time to switch your focus to the things that will slingshot you forward.
					</li>
					<li>
						You cannot be afraid to disappoint people. You have to live the life <b>you want</b> to live. Sometimes, that means being the motherfucker 
						who can put a middle finger up to everyone in the room and be totally comfortable with that.
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Live life for yourself. You only get one chance. There ain't no redos.
                    </div>
					<li>
						This shit ain't permanent. <i>Life is the ultimate competitor</i>. It takes no days off, and it won't care if you've made some money or got a 
						promotion at work. All that means is you are good to go for a moment or two. <mark>No matter how badass and successful you think you are, 
						trust me, there is a semi coming around a blind curve, ready to <u>smack you in the fucking mouth when you are comfortable as all hell.</u></mark>
					</li>
					<li>
						I've always been a man of action and service, and I know I would not be able to inspire people by <u>simply talking about the things I did in my past</u>. 
						I gave myself one rule before joining social media: <mark>if I can't live it. I won't speak it</mark>.
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Walk the talk, practice what you preach. Cut the bullshit and put it into action.
                    </div>
					<li>
						You must speak the truth and be willing to listen to it. Don't be afraid of your weakness or doubt. 
						Don't be embarrassed and pretend it doesn't exist. It surfaced for a reason, so use it to flip the dynamic of your life.
					</li>
					<li>
						Winner's mentality. Winners in life see everything they experience and everything they hear, see, and feel as <b>pure energy</b>. 
						They do not live disposable, single-use lives. <mark>They discard nothing and refurbished everything.</mark>
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Winners harvest lessons and growth by revisiting pain and failures. They dive into every crevice to mine golden nuggets of doubt and hate.
						They ring out every single last drop and find stength within it all.  
                    </div>
					<li>
						“Everything I did on my own time was for my own personal fulfillment and growth. 
						I damn sure didn't do it for attention. Yet, I was often misunderstood.”
					</li>
					<li>
						“Difficult workouts and long study sessions tended to spotlight all my weak points. 
						My desire to continue to eat like shit, <u>my natural impulse to cut corners in almost everything I did</u>, my general lack of drive, 
						and my flagging attention during those marathon ASVAB study sessions revealed <mark>my willingness to settle for mediocrity.</mark>”
					</li>
					<li>
						“In my Mental Lab, <u>each physical workout became a test of my mental fortitude</u>. <b>I stopped caring about how my body looked.</b>
						You don't need 6-pack abs when your mind is steel-plated. From that point on, each run, every hour on the pull-up bar, and all my 
						late-night study sessions <mark>became <b>experiments</b> conducted to see how long my mind would hold out</mark> when I continued to apply more 
						and more pressure. I was creating a motherfucker that was <i>mentally prepared</i> to do anything it took to become a SEAL.”
					</li>
					<li>
						“If you don't feel good enough, if your life lacks meaning and time feels like it's slipping through your fingers, 
						there is only one option. <mark><b>Recreate yourself in your own Mental Lab.</b></mark>”
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Alter egos! If you can't do it, create someone who can. 
                    </div>
					<li>
						“I was a part-time savage at best, a glorified <i>Weekend Warrior</i>. 
						Weekend Warriors do hard things when they fit into their busy schedules. 
						They do them to check a box and only when they want to. <u>Then, they dial it back after a couple of long, hard days</u>. 
						<mark>When you are a full-time savage, <b>it's a lifestyle</b>. There is no “want to”. There is only “must do.”</mark>
					</li>
					<li>
						“<mark>Mental toughness and resilience fade if they aren't used consistently.</mark> I say it all the time: <u>you are either getting better, 
						or you're getting worse. <b>You're not staying the same</b></u>. And I'd failed to heed my own words. 
						I wasn't training to gain any longer. <u>I had become a maintenance man</u>, and while it's certainly possible to maintain muscle tone and a certain 
						level of cardiovascular fitness, <b>you cannot maintain the savage mind</b>.”
					</li>
					<li>
						“If you stop grabbing iron with your bare hands, they will lose their callouses. 
						Your mind works the same way. You have to fight to keep that mindset of getting up every day to get after it because it wants to go away.”
					</li>
					<li>
						“But praise- whether it comes from your supervisors, your family, or anyone else— has a downside. 
						It can soother the inner savage and keep you from feeling <u>the need to grind</u>.”
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> We're not fucking thirsty for the attention of others. It's all about ourselves. Stay focused.  
                    </div>
					<li>
						“<mark>Everything in life comes down to how we handle those crucial <b>seconds</b></mark>. When psychological, physical, or emotional pressure redlines, 
						your adrenal glands go haywire, and you are no longer in control. <mark>What separates a true savage from everybody else is <b>the ability to 
						regain control of their mind in the split second, despite the fact that all is still fucked!</b></mark>”
					</li>
					<li>
						“Our lives aren't built on hours, days, weeks or years. Hell Week is 130 hours but it's not the hours that kill you.
						And it's not the pain, the exhaustion, or the cold. It is the 468,000 seconds that you must win. It only takes one of those motherfuckers- 
						when it all becomes too much and you just can't take it anymore- to bring you down.”
					</li>
					<li>
						“<mark><b><u>Life, like Hell Week, is built on seconds that you must win, repeatedly</u></b></mark>. When you are trying to lose weight or quit drinking or using drugs, 
						your moment of weakness can be counted in seconds, and <i>you'll need to be ready to win those seconds</i>.”
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Nothing can beat mental preparation.  
                    </div>
					<li>
						“Every experience on earth is <b>finite</b>. It will end someday, and that makes it doable, but the outcome hinges on those crucial seconds you must win!”
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Your life is ultimately determined by the decisions you make in difficult situations.   
                    </div>
					<li>
						“It's all well and good to have success and reach a certain level, but <mark>I really don't give a fuck what you did yesterday</mark>. 
						Maybe you finished Ultraman or graduated from Harvard. I do not care. <mark><u>Respect is earned every day</u></mark> by walking up early, 
						challenging yourself with new dreams or digging up old nightmares, and <mark>embracing the suck like you have nothing and 
						<b>have never done a damn thing in your life</b></mark>.”
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Humility>    
                    </div>
					<li>
						“There are no days off, and there is no downtime when you are <b><u>obsessed</u></b> with being great. 
						That is what it takes to be the baddest motherfucker ever at what you do.”
					</li>
					<li>
						“<mark><b>When a half-asses job doesn't bother you, it speaks volumes about the kind of person you are</b></mark>. 
						And until you start feeling a sense of <b><u>pride</u></b> and <b><u>self-respect</u></b> in the work you do, no matter how small or overlooked those jobs might be, 
						you will continue to half-ass your life. I knew I had every reason in the world to rebel and remain a lazy motherfucker. 
						I also sensed that would only make me more miserable, so I adapted. But no matter how well I did or how fast I completed a given task, 
						there were no atta' boys or weekly allowance. No ice cream cones or surprise gifts, hugs, or high fives. 
						In Sgt. Jack's mind, <mark><b><u>I was finally doing what I should have been doing all along</u></b></mark>.”
					</li>
					
					<li>
						“First, you must recognize that you have fallen off or are perpetually falling short. 
						Next, accept that you are on your own. Nobody will come save you. 
						They may show you an example, like Sgt. Jack did for me and I'm doing for you right now, but it will be up to you to do the work.
						Then, you must become a disciple of discipline. ”
					</li>
					<li>
						“We've all heard parents say, “He is only a teenager,” or “She's only in college,” when explaining bad habits 
						or poor choices. The question is, when is the right to start living instead of merely existing?”
					</li>
					<li>
						“We wish we could be born again as some other motherfucked in some other time and place. 
						Well, I am proof that rebirth is possible through discipline, which is the only thing capable of altering 
						your DNA. It is the skeleton key that can get you past all the gatekeepers and into each and every room you 
						wish to enter. Even the ones built to keep you the fuck out!”
					</li>
					<li>
						“Allow discipline to seep into your cells until work becomes a reflex as automatic as breathing. 
						With discipline as your medium, your life will become a work of art.”
					</li>
					<li>
						“Our phones and social media have turned too many of us inside out with envy and greed as we get 
						inundated with other people's success, their new cars and houses, big contracts, resort vacations, 
						and romantic getaways. We see how much fun everyone else is having and feel like the world is passing us by, 
						so we bitch about it and then wonder why we are not where we want to be.”
					</li>
					<li>
						"When you become disciplined, you don't have time for that bullshit. Your insecurities become alarm bells reminding you that doing your chores 
						or homework to the utmost of your ability and putting in extra time on the job or in the gym are requirements for a life well-lived."
					</li>
					<li>
						"A drive for self-optimization and daily repetition will build your capacity for work and give you confidence that you can take on more. 
						With discipline as your engine, your workload and output will double, then triple."
					</li>
					<li>
						“We cannot get time back, so we must be minute hoarders. The earlier I get up, the more I do. 
						The less time I stay in pity-party-feel-sorry-for-myself land, the stronger I become and the more daylight I see 
						between me and everyone else."
					</li>
					<li>
						“Humility is the antidote to self-pity. It keeps you rooted in reality and your emotions in check. 
						I'm not suggesting you should be satisfied with an entry-level job. I'm never satisfied, but you must appreciate what you have 
						while staying hungry enough to learn everything you can. You need to learn to wash the dishes, flip the burgers, sweep up the job site, 
						sweat over the deep fryer, and answer the phone. That's how you bild proficiency. It's important to learn every aspect of a business 
						before you move up. You can't rise if you're weighed down by bitterness and entitlement. Humility hardens your spine and encourages 
						you to stand tall, secure in yourself no matter what anyone else thinks. And that has tremendous value.”
					</li>

					<li>
						"The pull to stay lazy was stronger than it had ever been. That's how it works when you're trying to change. 
						The call to remain complacent will only grow louder until you silence it with a pattern of behavior that leaves no doubt about your mission."
					</li>
					<li>
						“It was never about him, and that gave him strength.”
					</li>
					<li>
						"People who feel sorry for themselves are obsessed with their own problems and their own fate."
					</li>
					<li>“The higher I climb up in my life, the more I realize how much I need to mop that floor. 
						Because that's where all the knowledge is. There is no grit at the top, no tests of resolve in steak dinners, 
						five-star hotels, or spa treatments. Once you make it in this world, you have to freefall back to the bottom in 
						some way to keep learning and growing.I call this “trained humility.” It's a shedding of skin that allows you to 
						take on a mission that no one else can see and do whatever needs to be done next. Trained humility is service but also strength. 
						Because, when you are humble enough to remember that you'll never know it all, each lesson you learn only makes you hungrier to learn more, 
						and that will put you on a path that guarantees you will grow all the way to the grave." 
					</li>
					<li>"Continued growth only comes when you are willing to be humble"</li>
