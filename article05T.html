                <p> List of takeaways:
                    <li>“There are times in life when we become so disconnected from ourselves that we must drill down and rewire those cut 
                        connections in our hearts, minds, and souls.”
                    </li>
                    <div class="ind">Being connected, in touch, and real with yourself is so important. If you're not, it's going to show up 
                        in every aspect of your life   
                    </div>
                    <li>“<mark>There's no substance behind hope.</mark> It's not a muscle you can develop, and it's not rooted down deep. It's an emotion that 
                        comes and goes.” 
                    </li>
                    <div class="ind"> Hope is an emotion. Emotions are not constant nor consistent. Discipline > motivation. 
                    </div>
                    <li>“With each passing minute, they became more and more resilient until they started to <i>believe</i> that 
                        they would survive. Their confidence didn't fade as the hours piled up; it actually grew!”
                    </li>
                    <div class="ind"> They began to believe because they were proving to themselves what they were capable of. 
                        All of the hurdles they have jumped fuel their belief in their abilities, the faith they had in themselves refused 
                        to let them quit as it got increasingly harder.  
                    </div>
					<li>
						<mark>“Belief is born in resilience”</mark>
					</li>
					<li>
						“Many people get it twisted and think my accomplishments directly correlate to my potential. My accomplishments do not equate to my potential. 
						The little I had was buried so deep most people would never have found it. Not only did I find it, I learned to maximize it.”
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Maximizing minimal potential. Hard work beats talent. Every. Fucking. Time.
					</div>
					<li>
						"A lot of folks feel like they are missing something in their lives - something money can't buy - and that makes them miserable. 
						The familiar gnawing in their gut returns, reminding them that the life they are living is not the fullest expression of who they 
						are or might become. Unfortunately, most people are not desperate enough to do anything about it. 
						<mark>You could be itchy as fuck to experience something different, to be somewhere different, or to become someone different, 
						but when the <u>slightest resistance</u> arises to challenge your resolve, you moonwalk right back </mark>into the unsatisfied person 
						you were before. Still itchy, still jonesing to be someone new, yet still trapped in your unfulfilling status quo."
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Toughen up and see it through. Become that bitch. Live life for yourself.
                    </div>
					<li>
						"I'm still haunted, but I've traded in my demons for evil-ass angels, and now, it's a good haunting. 
						I'm haunted by my future goals. Not my past failures. I'm haunted by what I may still become. 
						<mark>I'm haunted by my own thirst for evolution."</mark>
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Stay hungry. Stay real. Don't let your vision get blurred.
                    </div>
					<li>
						"All of our dreams and visions come with <u>expiration dates</u> etched in invisible ink. 
						Windows of opportunity can and do close, so it's imperative that we <mark>do not waste time on bullshit.</mark>
						None of us have any clue what's coming for us or when our time might run out, which is why I do my best to ignore anything that is 
						counterproductive. <u>I'm not suggesting that we act like robots, but we need to understand that 
						<i>forward motion gives our lives momentum.</i></u>"
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Get it done, breathe life to your goals. Don't let it stay in the drafts until it's too late. 
						And don't get caught up in the past, my dear, it's already over.  
                    </div>
					<li>
						"I just knew that I could not throw in the towel, and neither can you. Because there is no towel in our corner. 
						There is only water and a cut man. And if those are your only options, you have no choice but to keep fighting until you overcome 
						every last thing that once held you the fuck back."
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> There is no plan B. It's all or nothing, baby, so fucking full send it.  
                    </div>
					<li>
						You have been preoccupied by bullshit for way too long. It's time to switch your focus to the things that will slingshot you forward.
					</li>
					<li>
						You cannot be afraid to disappoint people. You have to live the life <b>you want</b> to live. Sometimes, that means being the motherfucker 
						who can put a middle finger up to everyone in the room and be totally comfortable with that.
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Live life for yourself. You only get one chance. There ain't no redos.
                    </div>
					<li>
						This shit ain't permanent. <i>Life is the ultimate competitor</i>. It takes no days off, and it won't care if you've made some money or got a 
						promotion at work. All that means is you are good to go for a moment or two. <mark>No matter how badass and successful you think you are, 
						trust me, there is a semi coming around a blind curve, ready to <u>smack you in the fucking mouth when you are comfortable as all hell.</u></mark>
					</li>
					<li>
						I've always been a man of action and service, and I know I would not be able to inspire people by <u>simply talking about the things I did in my past</u>. 
						I gave myself one rule before joining social media: <mark>if I can't live it. I won't speak it</mark>.
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Walk the talk, practice what you preach. Cut the bullshit and put it into action.
                    </div>
					<li>
						You must speak the truth and be willing to listen to it. Don't be afraid of your weakness or doubt. 
						Don't be embarrassed and pretend it doesn't exist. It surfaced for a reason, so use it to flip the dynamic of your life.
					</li>
					<li>
						Winner's mentality. Winners in life see everything they experience and everything they hear, see, and feel as <b>pure energy</b>. 
						They do not live disposable, single-use lives. <mark>They discard nothing and refurbished everything.</mark>
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Winners harvest lessons and growth by revisiting pain and failures. They dive into every crevice to mine golden nuggets of doubt and hate.
						They ring out every single last drop and find stength within it all.  
                    </div>
					<li>
						“Everything I did on my own time was for my own personal fulfillment and growth. 
						I damn sure didn't do it for attention. Yet, I was often misunderstood.”
					</li>
					<li>
						“Difficult workouts and long study sessions tended to spotlight all my weak points. 
						My desire to continue to eat like shit, <u>my natural impulse to cut corners in almost everything I did</u>, my general lack of drive, 
						and my flagging attention during those marathon ASVAB study sessions revealed <mark>my willingness to settle for mediocrity.</mark>”
					</li>
					<li>
						“In my Mental Lab, <u>each physical workout became a test of my mental fortitude</u>. <b>I stopped caring about how my body looked.</b>
						You don't need 6-pack abs when your mind is steel-plated. From that point on, each run, every hour on the pull-up bar, and all my 
						late-night study sessions <mark>became <b>experiments</b> conducted to see how long my mind would hold out</mark> when I continued to apply more 
						and more pressure. I was creating a motherfucker that was <i>mentally prepared</i> to do anything it took to become a SEAL.”
					</li>
					<li>
						“If you don't feel good enough, if your life lacks meaning and time feels like it's slipping through your fingers, 
						there is only one option. <mark><b>Recreate yourself in your own Mental Lab.</b></mark>”
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Alter egos! If you can't do it, create someone who can. 
                    </div>
					<li>
						“I was a part-time savage at best, a glorified <i>Weekend Warrior</i>. 
						Weekend Warriors do hard things when they fit into their busy schedules. 
						They do them to check a box and only when they want to. <u>Then, they dial it back after a couple of long, hard days</u>. 
						<mark>When you are a full-time savage, <b>it's a lifestyle</b>. There is no “want to”. There is only “must do.”</mark>
					</li>
					<li>
						“<mark>Mental toughness and resilience fade if they aren't used consistently.</mark> I say it all the time: <u>you are either getting better, 
						or you're getting worse. <b>You're not staying the same</b></u>. And I'd failed to heed my own words. 
						I wasn't training to gain any longer. <u>I had become a maintenance man</u>, and while it's certainly possible to maintain muscle tone and a certain 
						level of cardiovascular fitness, <b>you cannot maintain the savage mind</b>.”
					</li>
					<li>
						“If you stop grabbing iron with your bare hands, they will lose their callouses. 
						Your mind works the same way. You have to fight to keep that mindset of getting up every day to get after it because it wants to go away.”
					</li>
					<li>
						“But praise- whether it comes from your supervisors, your family, or anyone else— has a downside. 
						It can soother the inner savage and keep you from feeling <u>the need to grind</u>.”
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> We're not fucking thirsty for the attention of others. It's all about ourselves. Stay focused.  
                    </div>
                </p>
				<p><h4>
					Rise up, motherfuckers. Let's work!
