				<p>
					blah blah blah.

                <p> List of takeaways:
                    <li>“There are times in life when we become so disconnected from ourselves that we must drill down and rewire those cut 
                        connections in our hearts, minds, and souls.”
                    </li>
                    <div class="ind">Being connected, in touch, and real with yourself is so important. If you're not, it's going to show up 
                        in every aspect of your life   
                    </div>
                    <li>“<mark>There's no substance behind hope.</mark> It's not a muscle you can develop, and it's not rooted down deep. It's an emotion that 
                        comes and goes.” 
                    </li>
                    <div class="ind"> Hope is an emotion. Emotions are not constant nor consistent. Discipline > motivation. 
                    </div>
                    <li>“With each passing minute, they became more and more resilient until they started to <i>believe</i> that 
                        they would survive. Their confidence didn't fade as the hours piled up; it actually grew!”
                    </li>
                    <div class="ind"> They began to believe because they were proving to themselves what they were capable of. 
                        All of the hurdles they have jumped fuel their belief in their abilities, the faith they had in themselves refused 
                        to let them quit as it got increasingly harder.  
                    </div>
					<li>
						<mark>“Belief is born in resilience”</mark>
					</li>
					<li>
						“Many people get it twisted and think my accomplishments directly correlate to my potential. My accomplishments do not equate to my potential. 
						The little I had was buried so deep most people would never have found it. Not only did I find it, I learned to maximize it.”
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Maximizing minimal potential. Hard work beats talent. Every. Fucking. Time.
					</div>
					<li>
						"A lot of folks feel like they are missing something in their lives - something money can't buy - and that makes them miserable. 
						The familiar gnawing in their gut returns, reminding them that the life they are living is not the fullest expression of who they 
						are or might become. Unfortunately, most people are not desperate enough to do anything about it. 
						<mark>You could be itchy as fuck to experience something different, to be somewhere different, or to become someone different, 
						but when the <u>slightest resistance</u> arises to challenge your resolve, you moonwalk right back </mark>into the unsatisfied person 
						you were before. Still itchy, still jonesing to be someone new, yet still trapped in your unfulfilling status quo."
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Toughen up and see it through. Become that bitch. Live life for yourself.
                    </div>
					<li>
						I'm still haunted, but I've traded in my demons for evil-ass angels, and now, it's a good haunting. 
						I'm haunted by my future goals. Not my past failures. I'm haunted by what I may still become. 
						<mark>I'm haunted by my own thirst for evolution.</mark>
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Stay hungry. Stay real. Don't let your vision get blurred.
                    </div>
					<li>
						All of our dreams and visions come with <u>expiration dates</u> etched in invisible ink. 
						Windows of opportunity can and do close, so it's imperative that we <mark>do not waste time on bullshit.</mark>
						None of us have any clue what's coming for us or when our time might run out, which is why I do my best to ignore anything that is 
						counterproductive. <u>I'm not suggesting that we act like robots, but we need to understand that <i>forward motion gives our lives momentum.</i></u>
					</li>
					<div class="ind"> Get it done, breathe life to your goals. Don't let it stay in the drafts until it's too late. And don't get caught up in the past, my dear, it's already over.  
                    </div>
                </p>

					Rise up, motherfuckers. Let's work!
