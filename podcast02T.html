				<h4>
					A little on overthinking, overanalyzing, and being over-involved.    
				</h4>
				<p>
                    <li> We do not need to constantly be 'problem-solving'. Trust that problems will resolve themselves. The situation may still be unfolding and requires more time
                        to take shape. </li>
					<li> Over-analyzing, overthinking, and constantly problem-solving tend to do more harm than good. This is like always checking to see when a cake is ready. 
						Opening the oven every 5 min, not only ruins the experience, but you're probably also doing more harm than good. </li>
                    <li>You can't force something into reality. The negative energy that you are directing toward whatever you desire is coming from a place of anxiety, 
						frustration, or anger. 
						This ultimately does nothing to help you bring what you desire to reality, and is rather, pushing it further away.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The thoughts that we have towards our desired reality will influence how we act and orientate ourselves to opportunities. 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        It is important to notice our quality of attention towards our desires. For example, when we have a blemish on our face, people tell us to leave it. 
						Don't touch it, and don't try and fix it yourself. Just let it run its own course. It may be uncomfortable, it may feel weird. 
						But the more you try to fix it yourself, the worse it gets. 
						This is similar to our own desires in life. When an issue becomes too overwhelming, set it aside, and leave it alone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Acknowledge that the quality of your attention matters and that your energy is valuable. 
						Learn to set it aside when it becomes too consuming, and be intentional with what energy you're putting into it.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Sometimes, we just need to give ourselves some space and allow ourselves to neutralize. If this idea scares you, 
                        think about how every system in our body functions smoothly without us knowing how or without us controlling it.
                    </li>
