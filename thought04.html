			<h2><i>Riding the wave</i></h2>
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					The air was crisp, the day was still dark, and the velvet drapes fluttered in the breeze. 
					Valerie laid in bed, listening to the grasshoppers click under the low-hung moon. 
					She turned towards the alarm clock on her dresser; 4:08 am. Hauling herself out of bed,
					she stroked her fingertips against the clean, white wall in search of the light switch. 
					Valerie drank the glass of water on her bedside table next to the neatly folded clothes she had 
					chosen the night before. She made sure to safely tuck her lucky necklace beneath her shirt. 
					Valerie’s father gave her the pendant, a small emerald gem, when he was diagnosed with lung cancer. 
					Just a month ago, her father was admitted to the hospital for long-term care. The sound of Valerie’s 
					phone buzzing filled the room. It was her father, wishing her luck as he gasped for air between his words. 
					The phone dug into the palm of her hand as she firmly grasped onto it, for she desperately yearned for her father. 
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					After waiting hours in the airport, the plane was finally ready to board. She tucked herself in the seat and clamped the 
					seatbelt in preparation for take-off. The engine roared increasingly louder before blasting down the runway. 
					She was awakened by other passengers shuffling, signaling her arrival.
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					The scenery was beautiful. The sun’s golden beams reflected off the sea as Valerie headed towards the white-sand beach, 
					joining the group of competitors gathering ahead; all of whom had unique numbers plastered on their waists. In the blazing sun, 
					they chattered anxiously, but Valerie was drawn to the vigorous blue sea. As the judge began to call out competitor numbers, 
					Valerie listened intently for hers, but a call from the hospital interrupted her focus. 
					Her heart sank as she picked up the call, scrunching her toes into the warm sand, feeling it fill the gaps between her toes.
				</p>
				
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					“Hello, Ms.Valerie?” A lady asked softly. <br> 
					She held her breath, “Yes, that’s me.” The weight of the silence settled on her chest like an elephant.

				</p>
				
				<p style="text-indent: 40px">
					“...Your father might not make it past tonight. It’ll be best if you could visit him. ” 
Valerie’s heart stopped and she stared with her eyes wide open. The ground was crumbling beneath her feet, but she was rooted to her place. 
					She whispered a thank you, barely moving a muscle as her voice quivered. She wanted nothing else but to be on 
					the next plane home and to hold his hand at his bedside. Her tears puddled around her waterline, but her 
					father’s message from this morning replayed in her mind, like a videotape on loop. “Hey Val…I know today’s a 
					big day for you. Just wanted you to know that I’ll always cheer you on and help you get back up when you fall. 
					Just like I used to when you first learned to surf. I’m sure you can do it, show ‘em how it's done.” She
					thought of the first time her father taught her to surf. Feeling one with nature; feeling out of control, 
					but free. She held tightly to the intimate memories of surfing with her father, as if his death would mean 
					the loss of those memories too. Her heart twisted as she reminisced about the past. She steadied her breath 
					as the hushing of the waves drew her back to the present. This was her only chance to join the Canadian team, 
					a dream shared by both her and her father. Her determination was further heightened as she wanted to share one 
					last win with her father. Her number was called. Her hands turned cold and clammy with sweat with her heart 
					racing as she walked towards the shore. She strode into the water, breathing deeply, though it did little to 
					quell her anxiety. She pressed her stomach against the textures of her board, bouncing with the waves. 
					She waited for a wave to catch, and there it was; she felt her opportunity. 
					She paddled as quick as her arms allowed, jumping to her feet at the absolute peak of the wave. 
					Adrenaline pumping through her body, she savored the salty air, and with it, came a peculiar sense of clarity. 
					This was her place, her time. “This is for you Dad.” She said to herself, gritting her teeth. She rode 
					the wave up and down, twisting and turning. Valerie was locked in, she was in her zone. 
					She saw the next wave coming: a big one. It rushed with great speed and hissed voraciously:; a barrel wave. 
					The awakening wind blew across her face as she raced towards the wave. She made it, she was inside the barrel. 
					It was smooth and quiet, the lip of the wave feathering in front of her. She saw the horizon through the end of 
					the barrel and finished her routine. She couldn't believe it. She did it! She went back towards the shore and 
					was nearly drowned with applause and cheers. Overwhelmed with a sense of achievement, she kneeled down, 
					kissing her necklace as she shouted with joy. Hours passed and it was time to announce the 
					competitors who have been selected to represent Canada’s Olympic team. Valerie’s heart was thumping so 
					wildly that she could hear it throbbing in her ears. “After much discussion, the Olympic 
					committee would like to congratulate Valerie!” The judge announced cheerfully. 
					Time seemed to slow down and Valerie’s eyes widened. All the other contestants were clapping and 
					cheering as she began to tear up. Grinning from ear to ear, she proudly walked to the podium. 
					The weight of the gold medal fell upon her and tears began to flow down her dried, crusty cheeks. 
					It felt so surreal. She took a deep bow and raised both her hands high. Valerie raced off the podium 
					after the ceremony and called her father. Waiting for her father to pick up, she shifted her weight 
					from one foot to the other, pacing around on the sand. “Hello?” Her father finally answered faintly. 
					Valerie gulped hard. “I did it,  Dad. I qualified for the Olympics.” She shut her eyes, 
					trying to stop herself from sobbing. “That's my girl.” Her father whispered with all his might and pride. 
					He smiled as the phone slipped out of his hand, “Dad? Dad!” echoed from the phone as he shut his eyes.
