					You deserve to stop living at an unsustainable pace.
				</h4
				<p>
					It's intressting that so many people are overwhelmed, overcommitted, and 
					overworked doing exactly what they thought they wanted to do with their lives. Too many people build lives they want to escape from. 
					And that's not how I want my future to be like. 
				</p>
				<p> Avoiding burnout does not HAVE to mean creating a less bussy life and taking time off ALL THE TIME. It could be, if that's what works for you,
					but it doesn't have to be. In fact, life can become a little busier, crazier, and more complicated as long as inside of us, there's a 
					deeper peace, a greater sense of joy, and a way of dealing with the constantly escalating demands of life and leadership. </p>
				<p>
					Think about it, time <i>off</i>  won't heal you when the problem is how you spend your time <i>on</i>. It's ludicrous to think that a 
					few days off here or a few months off there are going to resolve the issues created by a perpetually overwhelming life. It's simply not 
					sustainable.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Before we dive in, it's important to define thriving. For me, to really thrive doesn't mean you're succeeding in just one part of your life; 
					it means you're thriving in ALL of it. Driven people often excuse having terrible personal lives because they're winning at work. But I personally
					don't stand by that anymore. Winning at work while losing at home means you're losing. Period.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following is a list of quotes from Newport in his book that I found valuable. For some, you may find little annotations and others may stand alone.  
					<ul>
						<li>"The most prosperous people who ever lived (which is everyone in the developed world in the twenty-first century) 
							have made their lives about survival."</li>
						<li>" Most people concentrate on managing their time but never think about managing their energy.
							 But leveraging your energy is where you start to see exponential results. 
							When you leverage your energy, you'll realize you're capable of producing not just <i>more</i> work but much <i>better</i> work than 
							you thought possible."</li>
						<li><mark>"Live in a way today that will help you thrive tomorrow."</mark></li>
						<li>" I have the time to sit on my front porch too. I can relax any time I want, watching the world pass me by. 
							And if I'm not doing that, it's because I chose not to do it and instead opted for something I felt was more valuable in the moment."</li>
						<li>"Even though you have twenty-four equal hours in the day, not all hours feel equal. You sprint through some hours and drag yourself 
							through others."</li>
						<li>"The value of this book is like paint: it's all in the application."</li>
					</ul>					  
				</p>

				<h4>Mental Shift 1: Tell The Truth About Time</h4>
				<p>
					 Eliminate the excuses, and you start to move forward, because you can make excusses or progress but  you can't make both. So 
					 start telling yourself the truth. 
					 <li>I had the time. I didn't take it.</li>
					 <li>I had a chance to get it done. I didn't do it.</li>
					 <li>I was able to finish it. I just didn't.</li>
					 <li>I could. But I'm choosing not to. </li>
					 <li>It's not impossible. I'm just not making the time. </li>
					 <li>I'm <i>opting</i> to not meet.</li>
					 <li>I'm <i>deciding</i> to not work out.</li>
					 <li>I'm <i>choosing</i> to not go to the school play.</li>
					 And there- you admitted it to yourself. I realize it's a pretty brutal level of honesty, but the truth can be such a good friend.
					 After all, of all the lies we tell, the lies we tell ourselves are the most deadly. 
					 <b>So Stop saying you don't have the time. Start admitting you didn't make the time.</b>
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p><h4>
					So dig deeper, my friend. Give it your all, don't sit on the fence.  
				</h4></p>
