					You deserve to stop living at an unsustainable pace.
				</h4
				<p>
					It's intressting that so many people are overwhelmed, overcommitted, and 
					overworked doing exactly what they thought they wanted to do with their lives. Too many people build lives they want to escape from. 
					And that's not how I want my future to be like. 
				</p>
				<p> Avoiding burnout does not HAVE to mean creating a less bussy life and taking time off ALL THE TIME. It could be, if that's what works for you,
					but it doesn't have to be. In fact, life can become a little busier, crazier, and more complicated as long as inside of us, there's a 
					deeper peace, a greater sense of joy, and a way of dealing with the constantly escalating demands of life and leadership. </p>
				<p>
					Think about it, time <i>off</i>  won't heal you when the problem is how you spend your time <i>on</i>. It's ludicrous to think that a 
					few days off here or a few months off there are going to resolve the issues created by a perpetually overwhelming life. It's simply not 
					sustainable.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Following is a list of quotes from Newport in his book that I found valuable. For some, you may find little annotations and others may stand alone.  
					<ul>
						<li>"The most prosperous people who ever lived (which is everyone in the developed world in the twenty-first century) 
							have made their lives about survival."</li>
						<li>" Most people concentrate on managing their time but never think about managing their energy.
							 But leveraging your energy is where you start to see exponential results. 
							When you leverage your energy, you'll realize you're capable of producing not just <i>more</i> work but much <i>better</i> work than 
							you thought possible."</li>
					</ul>					  
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p><h4>
					So dig deeper, my friend. Give it your all, don't sit on the fence.  
				</h4></p>
