				<h4>
					    Stop it. Seriously. 
				</h4>
				<p>
					I wanted to open this post by posing the question, 'Do you catch yourself critizing yourself?' but allow me to change my wording,
					'How <i>often</i> do catch yourself criticizing yourself?'. In this era where we've all fall into the hole of hustle culture and chasing 
					perfection, I don't think anyone could truthful say that they dont critize themself. But stop and think about it. How does criticizing yourself
					actually help you? If we know that being loved, encouraged, and celebrated feels so darn good, if it keeps you going and helps you achieve your goals,
					why don't you do it for yourself? 
				</p>
				<p> Remember, everything that you want to be, you already are, my friend.</p>
				<p>
					Here's a list of quotes that I found empowering/insightful: 
					<li>"A high five is so much more than a slap of a hand. 
						It's a transfer of energy and belief from one person to another. 
						It awakens something within you. It's a reminder of something you've forgotten "</li>
					<li><mark>"You can work hard while being soft with your soul."</mark></li>
					<li>"You can take chances, screw up, learn the lesson, without burying yourself in shame."</li>
					<li><mark>"You can have huge ambitions and still treat yourself and others with gentle kindness."</mark></li>
					<li>"You can face really hard and terrible situations in life and double down on optimism, resilience, and faith to get you through."</li>
					<li>"I used to feel like I was pushing a boulder up a hill. Now I was leaving my bathroom every morning feeling the wind at my back." </li>
					<li>"Everything I'm about to teach you is <u>already in you</u>. Self-love is your birthright. As a baby, you loved the very sight of yourself."</li>
					<div class="ind"> You ARE everything you need. You are ALREADY who you want to be. You are just on your journey to becoming that person. Peace and patience, lovely souls.  
						</div>
					<li>"You are so much stronger than you give yourself credit for! Resilience is hardwired into your DNA. Think about when you learned to 
						crawl as a baby. You didn't just try once then give up. You didn't lay on the floor and gaze morosely at the ceiling."</li>
					<div class="ind">Live with resilience, ambition, and patience. Believe in divine timing.   
						</div>
					<li>"So often self-love is shown to be about fixing yourself. But self-love is really about falling in love with the parts of 
						yourself you've been trying to fix."</li>
					<div class="ind"> I better myself because I am worthy, not because there's something 'wrong'. I am worthy of feeling at my best.
						I am worthy of feeling at peace.
						</div>
					<li><mark>"Remember: the windshield in a car is bigger than the rearview mirror for good reason. 
						You're not supposed to go backward; you're supposed to drive forward and that means you must look AHEAD."</mark></li>
					<li>"No one else is still thinking about what happened five years ago, but you. No one is keeping score as diligently as you."</li>
					<div class="ind">So let it go, my dear, and let yourself breathe.    
						</div>
						<li>"Start the day in a positive state and you're more likely to take action. And action is the secret. You cant think your way to a new life.
							You must take the steps to create it. Basically, the high five sets you in motion to take control of your life."</li>
					   <li>"In every dream worth pursuing, the odds are against you."</li>
					   <div class="ind"> Stop waiting until everything lines up. Stop waiting to be ready. All that waiting is killing your dreams. Just screw it and go head first, you got this!
						Learning will come along the way :)
					</div>
					<li>
						"How you respond to failure separates the winners from the losers."
					</li>
					<li>"There is no way you worked this hard and will not be rewarded. You have to trust that there is something amazing 
						happening that you can't see right now."</li>
					<li>"Motivation is never going to be there when you need it."</li>
					<div class="ind"> Life is about decisions. Self-discipline > Motivation. 
					</div>
					<li>"Feeling fear is normal. It's what you do the moment after you feel the fear that makes a difference. 
						You can be scared and still be confident in your ability to face this. 
						You can feel the weight of the world on your shoulders and still stand tall."</li>
					<li>"You can always connect the dots in your life if you are looking back. 
						The true art is believing that this moment right now is a dot that is connecting you to something amazing that's coming in the future."</li>
					<li>"Trust is a major component of that - trusting yourself, your abilities, and in the divine nature of things. 
						That everything in your life is preparing you for something that hasn't happened yet. 
						You may not be able to see how all the dots connect on the map of your life, but they do indeed connect."</li>
					<li>"The point isn't to get things when you want them. 
						It's to allow those things that you want pull you forward through your fears and doubt and resignation."</li>
				</p>
				<p><i><b>Your relationship with yourself is the foundation of every relationship you have in life.</i> So cheer a little louder for yourself, push yourself
					a little further.
