				<h4>
					To do deep work, to live a deep life, and to experience deep joy. 
				</h4>
				<p>
					Rarely done, yet it's what fills the soul. Newport's book helped me come to this realization.
					No matter the scope, whether shallowly breezing through a study session or through daily life, the result produced is always <u> easily replicable</u> - your grades, your success, your legacy.  
				</p>
				<p><i><b> In order to be extraordinary, you need to dive deep.</b></i></p>
				<p>Before we jump into this book and all of its greatness, I want to first highlight the star of the show, 
					my super-duper important main knowledge points:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><h5><b>Roosevelt Dashes</b></h5></li>
						<p>Roosevelt dashes leverage artificial deadlines to help you systematically increase the level you can regularly achieve.
							The idea is to set a countdown timer on your phone, propping it up where you can't avoid seeing it as you work. Within the time-limit you set for yourself, 
							you should have a clear goal that you're working towards. You should be able to consistly beat the buzzer (or at least be close) , but to do so should require teeth-gritting concentration.
						</p>
						<li><h5><b>Productive Meditation</b></h5></li>
						<p>The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which youâ€™re occupied physically but not mentally- walking, jogging, driving, showering
							 -and focus your attention on a single well-defined problem. It takes advantage of time that would otherwise be wasted
							(such as walking the dog or commuting to work), and if done right, can actually increase your professional productivity instead of taking time away from your work.
						</p>
					</ul>
					
				<p>
					Following is a list of quotes from Newport in his book that I found valuable. For some, you may find little annotations and others may stand alone.  
					<ul>
						<li>"The <mark> short-term discomfort</mark> of concentration and planning bring <mark> long-term satisfication </mark> and the production of real value. "</li>
						<li>"Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not"</li>
						<li>"People are tending toward increasingly <mark> visible busyness</mark> because they lack a better way to demonstrate their value"</li>
						<div class="ind">'Visible busyness', what an interesting term! This quote reminds me of the poem 'Identity' by Julio Noboa Polanco. Often, actions are
								driven by what will get the loudest uproar of applause. Not what may be truly best for ourselves. Ditch this idea! Do it for yourself, dear!  
						</div>
						<li>"A deep life is not just economically lucrative, but also a life well lived."</li>
						<li>"What we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore plays in defining the quality of our life."</li>
						<div class="ind">Perspective changes everything! Things may happen <i>to</i> you or they happen <i>for</i> you.
						</div>
						<li>"Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love-is the sum of what you focus on."</li>
						<li>"By skillfully managing your attention, you can improve your world without changing anything concrete about it." </li>
						<li>"We have a <mark>finite amount</mark> of willpower that becomes depleted as we use it; it's like a muscle that tires. "</li>
						<li>"Distractions will drain our willpower until we can no longer resist. This is why we must <mark>move beyond good intentions</mark> 
							and add routines and rituals to minimize the amount of willpower necessary to transition and maintain concentration."</li>
						<div class="ind"> This quote reminds me of the book 'Atomic Habits' by James Clear. Our life is the product of our habits! Having strong habits reduce the costs
							on our willpower, and allows less time for the brain to think. Your brain automates your actions, so awesome!
						</div>
						<li>"The more you do the less you actually accomplish. Focus your energy to a specific goal to pursue during your deep work hours to ignite real results "</li>
						<div class="ind"> Yes! I feel that having a goal or a list of what you're going to accomplish in a deep work session is so important. Not only does it help you map it out
							but also allows you to evaluate how much work you've done. 
						</div>
						<li>When you work, work hard. When you're done, be done.</li>
					  </ul>					  
				</p>
				<p>
					So dig deeper, my friend. Give it your all, don't sit on the fence.
